# Zynq-Petalinux-Example

## The Repository
This repository is intended to be the minimal viable Petalinux project for a Zynq-7000 SOC.  It can then be used for evaluating new applications, modules, hardware, etc.

The example hdf file most likely will NOT work on your hardware, if you have some.  It is intended solely to allow Petalinux to generate the required collateral files that are used during the build process.  See the Xilinx documentation for how to generate an HDF file for your hardware.
